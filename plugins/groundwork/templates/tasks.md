# Tasks: {{title}}

> One task = one reviewable change, ordered so the suite stays green after each.
> `[P]` marks tasks on disjoint files. Legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done.
> Mark a task `[x]` only after its "done when" is verified.

- [ ] **T001** — [TODO]
  - **Files:** [TODO]
  - **Done when:** [TODO: verifiable]
  - **Covers:** FR-1

## Verification
- [ ] **T900** — full check/test command passes
- [ ] **T901** — every FR in the spec maps to at least one completed task
- [ ] **T902** — the spec's manual-test section was run by hand and matches
- [ ] **T903** — foundation docs (ARCHITECTURE/AGENTS/CONTRACTS/PROJECT) updated or explicitly unchanged; `groundwork.py fresh` is clean
